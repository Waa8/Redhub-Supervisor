## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/urgent-fix` - Critical production fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add AI-powered task enhancement
fix: resolve authentication token expiration
docs: update API documentation
refactor: optimize database queries
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:auth
npm run test:api

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable
- Mock external dependencies

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style
- Use ES6+ features

- Validate all inputs
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive API documentation

### Database
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Follow naming conventions for tables and columns
- Include proper indexes for performance
- Document schema changes

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security best practices

## 📚 Documentation
